        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I am Hugo Arias, a web developer specializing in blockchain and decentralized technologies. With a passion for creating innovative solutions, I focus on helping individuals and organizations build secure, functional, and scalable platforms.</p>
    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p>My journey into technology began in childhood as a gamer, which naturally led to a career in tech support and sales. Since 2021, I have been deeply involved in blockchain technology, developing decentralized applications and contributing to international hackathons. Through these experiences, I’ve refined my skills in web development, QA testing, and project management, using Agile methodologies like Scrum to ensure efficiency and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Although I am a psychologist by training, I have chosen not to practice in the short term. My experiences in the tech industry and working internationally have shifted my focus to a path more aligned with my passion for technology. This decision has allowed me to build technical expertise while leveraging the soft skills I developed as a psychologist—such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving—which are essential in managing projects and working effectively with diverse teams. The combination of these skills has been instrumental in my career, helping me deliver impactful, user-centered solutions while fostering strong collaboration across projects.</p>
